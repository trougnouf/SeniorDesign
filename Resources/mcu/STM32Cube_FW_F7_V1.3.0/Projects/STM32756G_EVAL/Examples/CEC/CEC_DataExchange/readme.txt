@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure and use the CEC peripheral to receive and 
transmit messages.


- Hardware Description

To use this example, two STM327x6G-EVAL boards (called Device_1 and 
Device_2) are loaded with the same software then connected through CEC lines

 /|\  In the firmware file main.h, uncomment the dedicated line to use
/_!_\ the CEC peripheral as STM32 device_1 or STM32 device_2.

- Software Description

The test unrolls as follows.

On TX side, one possible message can be transmitted and is indicated as
below on the transmitting board:
 - when Tamper push-button is pressed, LED1 toggles

Accordingly, the following happens on the RX side in case of successful
reception:
 - when Tamper push-button is pressed on TX side, 
     *  LED2, LED3 and LED4 toggle

In case of unsuccessful reception, only LED3 is turned on.

Practically, an EXTI line (EXTI15_10) is configured to generate an interrupt 
on each falling edge. 
A specific message is then transmitted by the CEC IP.
    - EXTI15_10 is mapped to PC.13

Then, on TX side,
  - when falling edge is detected on EXTI15_10 and EXTI line interrupt is detected
    on PC.13, LED1 toggles


In this example, HCLK is configured at 216 MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM327x6G-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - in main.h, uncomment DEVICE_1 for first board, uncomment DEVICE_2 for second board
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - With a wire, connect GPIOB-GPIO_PIN_6 between the 2 boards
 - Connect the ground of the 2 boards
 - Run the example
