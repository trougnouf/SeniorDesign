@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to 
encrypt and decrypt data using DES and TDES in all modes (ECB, CBC) Algorithm.

For this example, a firmware is used to interface with the Crypto peripheral 
in polling mode.

This example is behaves as follows:
1. DES
  - DES ECB Encryption
  - DES ECB Decryption
  - DES CBC Encryption
  - DES CBC Decryption
2. TDES
  - TDES ECB Encryption
  - TDES ECB Decryption
  - TDES CBC Encryption
  - TDES CBC Decryption

The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC 
HyperTerminal using the USART.

The USARTx is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Directory contents

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32756G-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
