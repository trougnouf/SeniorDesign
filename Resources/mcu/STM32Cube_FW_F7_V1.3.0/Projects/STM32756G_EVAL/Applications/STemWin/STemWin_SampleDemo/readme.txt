@par Application Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implement a sample
demonstration application allowing to show some of the STemWin Library capabilities 
on STM32F7x6 devices.

The list of modules to be used is configured into the file Demo/GUIDEMO.h

At the first run, after power OFF/ON, a touch screen calibration is needed: in
order to this, user is just requested to follow the displayed instructions.
Then all the demo modules are run sequentially. Throughout the demonstration, a
control frame window is displayed at the bottom right of the touch screen: it
includes a progress bar and two control buttons (Next + Halt) allowing to skip
or pause the currently running module.

LEDs 1 to 4 are continuously toggling to indicate that the Demo runs properly.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select the RTC clock source; in this 
      case the Backup domain will be reset in order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC  
      registers (including the backup registers) and RCC_BDCR register are set to their reset values.
	   
@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this application uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This application runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G_EVAL
    (STM32F7x6 Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily 
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application
