@par Application Description 

This application describes the software solution for substituting standalone EEPROM
by emulating the EEPROM mechanism using the on-chip Flash of STM32F7xx devices.

Please refer to AN3969 for further details regarding this application.

The application requires two Flash memory sectors of identical size allocated to non-volatile data:
one that is initially erased, and offers byte-by-byte programmability; the other that is ready
to take over when the former sector needs to be garbage-collected. A header field that occupies
the first half word (16-bit) of each sector indicates the sector status. Each of these sectors is
considered as a page.
The sectors used are Sector 2 and Sector 3 with a size of 32KB each one.

STM327x6G-EVAL's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is toggle when the example runs successfully.
  - LED3 is toggle in case of error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM327x6G-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
