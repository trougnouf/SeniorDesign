CPU vs MCU

	# of devices:
	Laser, bluetooth
	mic/Voice recognition
	Audio decoder
	camera, GPS
	flash, ram, sd
	
	SW libraries:
	OpenCV vs scratch, ffmpeg vs HW, Fully-featured navigation vs programmed routes, OSS voice recognition vs nearly impossible
	
	Powerful microcontroller: easy/flexible hw, more complicated sw. More learning opportunities, less likely to implement fancy features

Choice of MCU
	MSP430/Arduino: 16MHz is not powerful enough
	MSP432: Cortex-based, 48MHz-max
	Cortex-M7:
	Freescale Kinetic KV5x: $159 dev board, $199 programmer
	
	
	STMicroelectronics STM32F7, STM32L4 backup
	
	One of only two Cortex-M7 available at the time
	Flexibility: design is easily adaptable to any other ARM STM32 MCU
	STLinkV2
		Cheap programmer ($20), $10-47 dev board
		only 3 wires
	Cross-platform dev environment
		Eclipse/Java based

Dev environment
	Mostly free and open-source software:
	Eclipse OpenSTM32 plugin: GCC/GDB/OpenOCD
	STM32CubeMX
	FreeRTOS
