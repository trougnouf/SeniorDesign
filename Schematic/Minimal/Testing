Jumpers:
P5 3VEN-BATT
JP2 3VOUT-VCC
JP1 5VOUT-+5V

1. Check resistance between VCC and GND
2. Test battery voltage w/all jumpers out
3. Insert battery, connect USB, check VBAT and I_BAT
4. disconnect USB, connect P5
5. connect 3.3V jumper and check 3.3V

program: add 5v jumper and test

108kohm between battery terminals
0.38kohm between vcc and gnd
3.66v originally
took off usb and there is now 9kohm between vcc and gnd
w/p5 resistance between vcc and gnd is now 15-40+ kohm, increasing

v=ir -> i=v/r=3.7/20000=0.000185A

3.3/380=0.009
