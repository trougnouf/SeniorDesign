Status byte after reset: 0?
Does reset count as the first command to set the the mode to SPI?
Would (freq) work?
100mV from MISO


img7: reset -> 100111 (single, RS, D1, D0)
img8: 01001111(r) -> 10010011

img9(?): in receive mode but somehow sending (?). s/r:10010011=err,changing

Should receive 1000x011

// Reset: 11110000 = 0xf0
// Start burst mode: 00011111 = 0x1f
