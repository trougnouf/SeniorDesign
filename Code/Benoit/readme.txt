SW9000 contains the source code that ran the final presentations. It was developed using IAR, although the main.c file should be compatibly with any STM32 HAL compatible IDE.

SW2 ran on Sensewalk 2 during the demo. It is essentially the same code with different pins (sharing the same name for compatibility), and a blinking LED instead of a vibration motor.

Everything else was used for development with OpenSTM32 (GCC based Eclipse plugin)
